        In Apocalypse Made Easy!, teams of 4-6 people must work together to complete survival training simulations: finding shelter, forming alliances, and foraging for food, with all games physically situated in unique real locations across Vancouver and Kelowna BC.

        As a user researcher I:
            * Conducted quantiative analysis of game telemetry and user segments
            * Lead playtest sessions: utilizing cognitive walkthroughs, think aloud protcol, natural observation, critical incident logging
            * Lead focus groups
            * Created and administered surveys
            * Conducted qualitative thematic analysis on interview and playtest sessions

        I created a videoconferencing module designed to convey implicit nonverbal feedback from the audience while teleconferencing.

        We are in the process of protecting this invention with patent, so I am unable to say much more beyond this.
        My role on this project:

    * Technology inception and design
    * Software architecture (key technologies: Node.js, WebRTC, tensorflow.js)
    * Creating and running a mixed methods user study`,
