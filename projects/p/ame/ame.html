I was a <b>user researcher</b> on <b>Apocalypse Made Easy!</b>, a mobile, location based, cooperative survival game. 
<p/>
In Apocalypse Made Easy!, teams of 4-6 people must work together to complete survival training simulations: finding shelter, forming alliances, and foraging for food, with all games physically situated in unique real locations across Vancouver and Kelowna BC.
